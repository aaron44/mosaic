# `mosaic` â€“ an image pixelizer

`mosaic` is my final project for St. Olaf's CS 121 course. 

## Goals

- Take an image file (JPG) as input.
- Allow the user to choose a pixel size.
- Pixelate the image.
- Dislay the pixelated image.
- Give the user the option of saving the image to disk.


## TODO

- Implement the `pixelate` function.
- Create the `overlay` and `button` classes.
